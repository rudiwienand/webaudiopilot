## 🚀 TO INSTALL ON YOUR iPHONE - DO THIS:

### **If using Figma Make** (Easiest - Start Here!)

Your app is already live! Just:

1. **Find your Figma Make app URL**
   - It's the URL at the top of this page
   - Something like: `https://your-app.figmake.com`

2. **Open that URL on your iPhone in Safari**
   - Email yourself the link, or
   - Type it into Safari on your phone

3. **Tap the Share button** (bottom of screen)

4. **Tap "Add to Home Screen"**

5. **Tap "Add"**

6. **DONE!** Open the app from your home screen! 🎉

### **Icons (Optional - Makes it Pretty)**

Right now the app will install, but might have a generic icon. To fix:

**Option 1: Use My Generator (Recommended)**
1. Go to: `your-app-url/generate-icons.html`
2. Download both icon files
3. Add them to `/public/` folder
4. Redeploy

**Option 2: Skip for Now**
- The app works fine without custom icons!
- The iPhone will use a screenshot instead
- You can add icons later

## 🎵 AUDIO NOTES:

Since you're using Dropbox URLs:

✅ **Pros:**
- Already set up and working!
- No file uploads needed
- Easy to update sounds

⚠️ **Cons:**
- Requires internet connection
- Dropbox links could expire

**This is fine!** Most meditation apps stream audio anyway.

---

## 📱 AFTER INSTALLING:

1. **Look on your home screen**
   - You'll see your app icon (or screenshot)
   
2. **Tap it to open**
   - Opens in full-screen (no Safari UI!)
   - Looks like a native app
   
3. **Use normally**
   - Select chakra
   - Tap play
   - Adjust mandala controller
   - Enjoy your meditation! 🧘‍♀️

---

## 🧪 TEST FIRST (Recommended):

Before installing, open your app on iPhone Safari and make sure:

- ✅ Page loads
- ✅ You can select chakras
- ✅ Play button works
- ✅ Audio plays correctly
- ✅ Mandala controller responds to touch

If all that works → Install it!

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT IPHONE NOTES:

1. **MUST use Safari** (not Chrome!)
   - Only Safari can install web apps on iPhone
   
2. **Audio permissions**
   - First time: tap anywhere, then tap play
   - iOS requires user interaction before audio
   
3. **Dropbox links**
   - Make sure they're not expired
   - Check they allow direct downloads
   
4. **Internet needed**
   - The app caches UI, but audio streams from Dropbox
   - This is normal for meditation apps!

---

## 🎉 THAT'S IT!

**Literally this simple:**

1. Open your app URL in Safari on iPhone
2. Share → Add to Home Screen
3. Open and enjoy!

**The complicated stuff is already done!** I set up:
- ✅ PWA manifest
- ✅ Service worker  
- ✅ iOS optimization
- ✅ Audio engine
- ✅ All the UI

You just need to install it! 📱✨

## 🆘 IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK:

**Problem:** Can't find "Add to Home Screen"
- Make sure you're in Safari (not Chrome)
- Make sure you're on the deployed URL (not localhost)

**Problem:** Audio doesn't play
- Tap the screen first, then play
- Check Dropbox links are valid
- Make sure phone isn't on silent mode

**Problem:** App icon is generic
- Generate icons using `/generate-icons.html`
- Or just live with it - the app still works!
