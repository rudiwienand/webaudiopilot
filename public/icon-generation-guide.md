# App Icon Generation Guide

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files:

## Required Icons:
1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use an Online Generator (Easiest)
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a square image (at least 512x512px)
3. Download the generated icons
4. Place them in the `/public/` folder

### Option 2: Design Your Own
1. Create a square design (512x512px) with:
   - A chakra/meditation theme
   - The 7 chakra colors in a mandala pattern
   - Or use the Om symbol (ॐ)
   - Or use a lotus flower
2. Export as:
   - icon-192.png (192x192)
   - icon-512.png (512x512)
3. Place both files in the `/public/` folder

### Option 3: Simple SVG to PNG Conversion
1. Use this website: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any meditation/chakra related image
3. Download the package
4. Rename the appropriate sizes to icon-192.png and icon-512.png
5. Place in `/public/` folder

## Recommended Design:
- Use a gradient with purple/indigo colors (matching app theme)
- Include meditation/chakra symbolism
- Ensure it looks good on both light and dark backgrounds
- Keep it simple - icons are viewed at small sizes

## Temporary Placeholder:
Until you create custom icons, you can use any square PNG image (minimum 512x512) as a placeholder.
